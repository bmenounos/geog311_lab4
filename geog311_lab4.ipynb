    "## Lab 4: Debris Flows and Slope Stability Analysis (GEOG311)\n",

    " \n",
    "Debris flows represent a significant natural hazard in BC. Although areas prone to activity can be determined through careful air-photo analysis and site visitation, determining the exact timing of failure is difficult. Since debris-flows and shallow landslide often occur following extreme precipitation events, real-time monitoring of precipitation events provides one method of hazard evaluation. This exercise considers methods of estimating the precipitation factors leading to debris-flow activity. It will also introduce methods of determining debris-flow velocity and peak discharge from deposits in the field. Finally, we will consider an assessment of slope stability using an infinite slope model and the Fellenius method of slices.  \n",

    " \n",
    "#### Intensity and Duration of Precipitation \n",
    " \n",
    "Precipitation events are the most common trigger for debris-flow activity in alpine and mountain environments of British Columbia. Debris-flow often initiate from shallow, planar failures. This material can enter a gully or low-order stream, entrain additional material within the channel and may mobilize significant volumes of sediment. The climatological trigger for such events is rapid increase in pore-water pressure. This pore-water pressure increase occurs either during intense, low duration precipitation events (e.g. thunderstorms), or during storms of considerably long duration.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Often a post-failure analysis of debris-flow activity requires the inspection of intensity, duration data for the precipitation event of question and a comparison to intensity-duration curves of a given return interval (e.g. the 5, 10, or 20-year event).  \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Empirical Intensity-Duration Curve for Shallow Landsliding: **10 points** \n",
    " \n",
    "Caine (1989) compiled a data set of precipitation intensity and duration for storms known to have caused debris flows and shallow landslides. That data suggest a limiting-threshold of the form:\n",
    " \n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "I=14.82 \\cdot D^{-0.39}\\label{intendur} \n",
    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    " \n",
    "Where $I$ represents intensity ($mm \\cdot hr^{-1}$) and $D$ is the storm duration (hr). The values 14.82 and -0.39 are empirically-derived coefficients (model parameters) and define the intercept and slope of the relation on a log-log plot.  This relation works moderately well for shallow failures ($<$ 2-3 m deep) and for storms between 10 minutes to 10 days. \n",
    " \n",
    "In BC, two noteworthy precipitation events in 1980 and 1984 triggered widespread debris flows in southwestern BC (Church et al., 1987). Your task is to examine whether the intensity/duration of these rain storms as recorded at nearby, representative rain gauges exceeded the limiting threshold for shallow landsliding as defined in equation 1. Do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the precipitation data (jan_1984.txt, dec_1980.txt) into Pandas in the way that we've done in the past. \n",
    " \n",
    "2. Calculate the storm intensity ($mm  \\cdot hr^{-1}$) from the precipitation data (Duration in Hours, Depth in mm). \n",
    " \n",
    "3. Plot the intensity-duration curves for each storm using a log-log plot. Although called an 'intensity-duration' curve, make sure you plot duration as the independent variable.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Add Caine's empirical relation to the plot (use different color or line width so you can see it). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Were the storms were of sufficient intensity or duration to initiate failures (i.e. does intensity-duration curve exceed the empirical threshold)? \n"

    "# Debris Flow Discharge and Velocity/Volume Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Landslide hazards mapping and an assessment of the geomorphic significance of debris flows requires the calculation of debris flow volume or peak flow discharge ($Q_{max}$). Peak flow ($m^{3}s^{-1}$) estimates are often required for engineering purposes (e.g. 'design flows' for structures such as culvert and bridge crossings). Determination of total volume of a debris flow is required with constructing containment features for failed debris, or perhaps to estimate the contribution of failed sediments to downstream channels (e.g. fish habitat, channel aggradation). Estimates of $Q_{max}$ require not only the cross-sectional area of the flow, but also the velocity of the flowing material. Determination of flow velocity for floods can often be determined using Manning's Equation. Because debris flows do not behave as Newtonian materials, however, we require alternative methods.  \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Run-up of Debris Flows\n",
    " \n",
    "Run-up is the tendency for flowing earth materials (water, debris flows, or even lava) to deposit or 'run-up' higher on the upstream side of an object compared to the downstream side of an object. A good example of the process can be seen under bridges during high flows. On the upstream side of the piling, the water surface is deformed and tends to be higher than on the edges or downside side of the piling. For debris-flow deposits, the evidence of run-up is commonly observed as 'mud lines' on trees at the edge of the flow.  The faster the velocity, the greater the degree of run-up. If we assume conservation of energy, then the kinetic energy of the fluid ($\\frac{1}{2} m \\cdot u^{2}$) is transformed to potential energy ($mg\\cdot \\Delta h$). Equating the energy terms and solving for $u$ gives \n",

    "where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\\Delta$ h is the amount of run up on the up flow side of a protruding object (e.g. a tree or bridge piling), and $k$ is a constant. Assumptions required to use equation \\ref{runup} is that flow is perpendicular to the object, the material behaves as Newtonian substance, and frictional losses of energy are negligible. Since the material is not Newtonian equation \\ref{runup} over-predicts $\\bar{u}$ and tends to run up more than would be expected for a true fluid. The over-prediction depends on the viscosity of the material and corrected by the coefficient $k$. Assume that $k$=0.5 for our project. \n",

    "Consider the large landslide centered in photos C1, C2 (Houston Tommy Creek) from the laboratory exercise of last week. Use the following data collected in the field (and measured in the lab) to determine the factor of safety (FS) for the landslide. Assume that the water table was 1.5 m below the ground surface (and flow was parallel to the slope) when failure occurred. The following geotechnical properties were determined for the material: $\\gamma_{saturated}=27 kNm^{-3}$; $\\gamma_{dry}= 16 kNm^{-3}$; $\\phi'=23^{\\circ}$; $c=65 kPa$. The average hillslope angle prior to failure was $\\beta=24^{\\circ}$. The following data were also collected for the landslide. Assume for simplicity that the area of a given slice can be approximated by the product of depth(h) and length(L). \n",
